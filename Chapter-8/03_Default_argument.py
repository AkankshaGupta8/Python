def goodday(name , ending = "Thank you!"):
    print(f"gooday,  {name}")
    print(ending)

goodday("jam","Thanks")
goodday("kiran")


#this is little different from the function argument (if we put in def ending= thanks means if we give then it will print but we dont give means it will automatice give thanks at the end )
